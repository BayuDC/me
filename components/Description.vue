            My name is <b>Bayu Dwi Cahyono</b>. Usually called <b>Bayu</b> / <b>Bayy</b>. I am a
            <b>web developer</b> who always loves to learn the new latest technologies. I am specializing in
            <b>frontend</b> technologies, but I can also do a little <b>backend</b> stuff. I like
            <b>building websites</b> because it's <b>fun</b>, especially when people use my website or just opening it.
            When I'm bored with programming, I like to learn about <b>computer networks</b> and <b>electronics</b>.
